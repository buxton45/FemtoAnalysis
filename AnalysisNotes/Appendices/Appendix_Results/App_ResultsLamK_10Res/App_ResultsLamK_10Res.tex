\subsection{10 Residual Contributors Included in Fit}
\label{App_ResultsLamK_10Res}

This section presents fit results for which 10 residual contributors were assumed.
These contributors include those shared by the three contributor case (App. \ref{App_ResultsLamK_3Res}), ($\Sigma^{0}\mathrm{K}$, $\Xi^{0}\mathrm{K}$, $\Xi^{-}\mathrm{K}$) $\rightarrow \Lambda\mathrm{K}$, and additionally the contributors ($\Sigma^{* (+,-,0)}\mathrm{K}^{*0}$, $\Lambda\mathrm{K}^{*0}$, $\Sigma^{0}\mathrm{K}^{*0}$, $\Xi^{0}\mathrm{K}^{*0}$, $\Xi^{-}\mathrm{K}^{*0}$) $\rightarrow \Lambda\mathrm{K}$.
As stated at the beginning of App. \ref{App_Results}, most of the $\Sigma^{*}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{*}$ resonances will have decayed before kinetic freeze-out, and therefore it is best to treat $\Lambda$ and $\mathrm{K}$ particles originating from these resonances as primary, i.e. only using three residual contributors.
However, it is still interesting to examine how these additional shorter lived sources affect our fit result, as presented below.
For a comparison of these results to the case of three residual contributors, see Fig. \ref{figApp:Comparisons_3v10vNo} in App. \ref{App_ResultsLamK_FitMethComp}

  10 residual correlations in \LamK fits.  
  Extracted fit $R_{\mathrm{inv}}$ parameters as a function of pair transverse mass ($m_{\mathrm{T}}$) for various pair systems over several centralities. 
  The ALICE published data \cite{Adam:2015vja} are shown with transparent, open symbols.  
  The new \LamK results are shown with opaque, filled symbols.  
  The \mt value for the \LamK system is an average of those for the \LamKchP, \ALamKchM, and \LamKs systems.

  Extracted fit parameters for the case of 10 residual contributors for all of our \LamK systems.  
  [Top]: $\Im f_{0}$ vs. $\Re f_{0}$, together with $d_{0}$ to the right.  
  [Bottom]: $\lambda$ vs. Radius for the 0-10\% (blue), 10-30\% (green), and 30-50\% (red) centrality bins.  
  In the fit, all \LamK systems share common radii.
  The color scheme used in the panel are to be consistent with those in Fig. \ref{figApp:mTScalingOfRadii_10Res}.
  The cyan ([A] = Ref. \cite{Liu:2006xja}) and magenta ([B] = Ref. \cite{Mai:2009ce}) points show theoretical predictions made using chiral perturbation theory.
