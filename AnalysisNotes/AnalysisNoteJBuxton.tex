\begin{comment}
My abstract will be contained here.  The abstract will introduce my study and inform the reader about the content of this paper.  I will state the problem I tackle, and summarize (in one sentence) why no one else has yet to adequately answered the research question.  Next, I will explain (again, in one sentence) how I tackled the research question, and (in one sentence) how I went about doing the research which followed from this big idea (i.e. elaborate on previous sentence).  Finally, as a single sentence, I will state the key impact of my research.

We present results from a femtoscopic analysis of \LamK and $\Xi^{-}$\Kpm correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE experiment at the LHC.  
All pair combinations of \Lam and \ALam with \KchP, \KchM and \Ks are analyzed.  
The femtoscopic correlations are the result of strong final-state interactions, and are fit with a parametrization based on a model by R. Lednicky and V. L. Lyuboshitz \cite{Lednicky:82}.  
This allows us to both characterize the emission source and measure the scattering parameters for the particle pairs.  
We observe a large difference in the \LamKchP and \LamKchM correlations in pairs with low relative momenta (\kstar $\lesssim$ 100 MeV).   
The results suggest an effect arising from different quark-antiquark interactions in the pairs, i.e. $\rm s\bar{s}$ in \LamKchP and $\rm u\bar{u}$ in \LamKchM, or from different net strangeness for each system.  
To gain further insight into this hypothesis, we currently are conducting a $\Xi$K femtoscopic analysis.

I present the first femtoscopic analysis of \LamK correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV measured by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  
All pair combinations of \Lam and \ALam with \KchP, \KchM and \Ks are analyzed.  
The femtoscopic correlations result from strong final-state interactions, and are fit with a parametrization allowing us to both characterize the emission source and measure the scattering parameters for the particle pairs.  
We observe a large difference in the \LamKchP and \LamKchM correlations in pairs with low relative momenta (\kstar $\lesssim$ 100 MeV/$c$).   
This might suggest an effect arising from different quark-antiquark interactions within the pairs ($\rm s\bar{s}$ in \LamKchP and $\rm u\bar{u}$ in \LamKchM), or from different net strangeness for each system.  
To gain further insight into this hypothesis, we are currently conducting a $\Xi^{-}$\Kpm femtoscopic analysis, for which I present preliminary results.
