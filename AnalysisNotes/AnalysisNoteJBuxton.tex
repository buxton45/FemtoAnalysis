\begin{abstract}
My abstract will be contained here.  The abstract will introduce my study and inform the reader about the content of this paper.  I will state the problem I tackle, and summarize (in one sentence) why no one else has yet to adequately answered the research question.  Next, I will explain (again, in one sentence) how I tackled the research question, and (in one sentence) how I went about doing the research which followed from this big idea (i.e. elaborate on previous sentence).  Finally, as a single sentence, I will state the key impact of my research.
