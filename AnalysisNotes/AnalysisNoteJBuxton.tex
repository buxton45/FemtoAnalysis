\begin{abstract}
My abstract will be contained here.  The abstract will introduce my study and inform the reader about the content of this paper.  I will state the problem I tackle, and summarize (in one sentence) why no one else has yet to adequately answered the research question.  Next, I will explain (again, in one sentence) how I tackled the research question, and (in one sentence) how I went about doing the research which followed from this big idea (i.e. elaborate on previous sentence).  Finally, as a single sentence, I will state the key impact of my research.

We present results from a femtoscopic analysis of Lambda-Kaon correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE experiment at the LHC.  
All pair combinations of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ with K$^{+}$, K$^{-}$ and K$^{0}_{S}$ are analyzed.  
The femtoscopic correlations are the result of strong final-state interactions, and are fit with a parametrization based on a model by R. Lednicky and V. L. Lyuboshitz[1].  
This allows us to both characterize the emission source and measure the scattering parameters for the particle pairs.  
We observe a large difference in the $\Lambda$-K$^{+}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{-}$) and $\Lambda$-K$^{-}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{+}$) correlations in pairs with low relative momenta (k* $\lesssim$ 100 MeV).  
Additionally, the average of the $\Lambda$-K$^{+}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{-}$) and $\Lambda$-K$^{-}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{+}$) correlation functions is consistent with our $\Lambda$-K$^{0}_{S}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{0}_{S}$) measurement.  
The results suggest an effect arising from different quark-antiquark interactions in the pairs, i.e. $\rm s\bar{s}$ in $\Lambda$-K$^{+}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{-}$) and $\rm u\bar{u}$ in $\Lambda$-K$^{-}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{+}$).  
To gain further insight into this hypothesis, we currently are conducting a Cascade-Kaon femtoscopic analysis.
