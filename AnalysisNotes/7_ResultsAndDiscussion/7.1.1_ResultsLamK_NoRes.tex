\subsubsection{Results: \texorpdfstring{$\Lambda$K$^{0}_{S}$ and $\Lambda$K$^{\pm}$: No Residual Correlations Included in Fit}{TEXT}}
\label{ResultsLamK_NoRes}

Figures \ref{fig:LamK0wConjFits_NoRes}, \ref{fig:LamKchPwConjFits_NoRes}, and \ref{fig:LamKchMwConjFits_NoRes} (Section \ref{ResultsAndDiscussion}) show experimental data with fits for all studied centralities for \LamKs with \ALamKs, \LamKchP with \ALamKchM, and \LamKchM with \ALamKchP, respectively.
The parameter sets extracted from the fits can be found in Tables \ref{tab:FitResultsLamK0_NoRes} and \ref{tab:FitResultsLamKch_NoRes}.
All correlation functions were normalized in the range 0.32 $< k^{*} <$ 0.40 GeV/c, and fit in the range 0.0 $< k^{*} <$ 0.30 GeV/c.
For the $\Lambda$K$^{-}$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$K$^{+}$ analyses, the region 0.19 $< k^{*} <$ 0.23 GeV/c was excluded from the fit to exclude the bump caused by the $\Omega^{-}$ resonance.
The non-flat background was fit with a linear form from 0.6 $< k^{*} <$ 0.9 GeV/c.
The theoretical fit function was then multiplied by this background during the fitting process.

In the figures (\ref{fig:LamK0wConjFits_NoRes}, \ref{fig:LamKchPwConjFits_NoRes}, and \ref{fig:LamKchMwConjFits_NoRes}), the black solid line represents the ``raw" fit, i.e. not corrected for momentum resolution effects nor non-flat background.
The green line shows the fit to the non-flat background.  The purple points show the fit after momentum resolution and non-flat background corrections have been applied.
The initial values of the parameters is listed, as well as the final fit values with uncertainties.

For the $\Lambda$K$^{0}_{S}$ fits without residuals, $\lambda$ was restricted to [0.4, 0.6].

Figure \ref{fig:mTScalingOfRadii_NoRes} shows extracted $R_{\mathrm{inv}}$ parameters as a function of tranverse mass ($m_{\mathrm{T}}$) for various pair systems over several centralities.  The published ALICE data \cite{Adam:2015vja} is shown with transparent, open symbols.  The new $\Lambda$K results are shown with opaque, filled symbols.  The radii shown an increasing size with increasing centrality, as is expected from the simple geometric picture of the collisions.  The radii decrease in size with increasing $m_{\mathrm{T}}$, and we see an approximate scaling of the radii with transverse mass, as is expected in the presence of collective flow in the system.
