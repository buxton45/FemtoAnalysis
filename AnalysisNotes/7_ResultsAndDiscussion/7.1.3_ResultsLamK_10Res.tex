  \caption[$\Lambda$K$^{0}_{S}$($\bar{\Lambda}$K$^{0}_{S}$) Fits with 10 Residuals]{Fits, with 10 residual correlations included, to the $\Lambda$K$^{0}_{S}$ (left) and $\bar{\Lambda}$K$^{0}_{S}$ (right) data for the centralities 0-10\% (top), 10-30\% (middle), and 30-50\% (bottom).
The lines represent the statistical errors, while the boxes represent the systematic errors.
Each has unique $\lambda$ and normalization parameters.
The radii are shared amongst like centralities; the scattering parameters ($\mathbb{R}f_{0}$, $\mathbb{I}f_{0}$, $d_{0}$) are shared amongst all.
The black solid line represents the ``raw" fit, i.e. not corrected for momentum resolution effects nor non-flat background.  
The green line shows the fit to the non-flat background.
The purple points show the fit after momentum resolution and non-flat background corrections have been applied.
The initial values of the parameters is listed, as well as the final fit values with uncertainties.
Here, $R$ was restricted to [2.,10.] and $\Lambda$ was restricted to [0.1,0.8].}

Extracted fit $R_{\mathrm{inv}}$ parameters as a function of pair transverse mass ($m_{\mathrm{T}}$) for various pair systems over several centralities. The ALICE published data \cite{Adam:2015vja} is shown with transparent, open symbols.  The new $\Lambda$K results are shown with opaque, filled symbols.  In the left, the $\Lambda$K$^{+}$ (with it's conjugate pair) results are shown separately from the $\Lambda$K$^{-}$ (with it's conjugate pair) results.  In the right, all $\Lambda$K$^{\pm}$ results are averaged.}
