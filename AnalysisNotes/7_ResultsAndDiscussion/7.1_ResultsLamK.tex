\subsection{Results: \texorpdfstring{$\Lambda$K$^{0}_{S}$ and $\Lambda$K$^{\pm}$}{TEXT}}
\label{ResultsLamK}

In the following sections, we present results assuming (i) no residual correlations (Sec. \ref{ResultsLamK_NoRes}), (ii) three residual contributors (Sec. \ref{ResultsLamK_3Res}), and (iii) ten residual contributors (Sec. \ref{ResultsLamK_10Res}).  We find the case of three and ten contributors to be consistent, therefore we will quote the result utilizing three residuals as our final result.  The results shown, unless otherwise noted, use a polynomial fit to the THERMINATOR simulation to handle the non-flat background, and \LamKchPALamKchM radii are shared with \LamKchMALamKchP.


Before beginning, I first collect a summary of my final results in Figure \ref{fig:ScattParams_Final}.  In the summary plot, we show the extracted scattering parameters in the form of a Im[f$_{0}$] vs Re[f$_{0}$] plot, which includes the d$_{0}$ values to the right side.  We also show the $\lambda$ vs. radius parameters for all three of our studied centrality bins.  In Fig. \ref{fig:ScattParams_Final}, three residual contributors were used, and the background was modeled by a (6$^{\mathrm{th}}$-)order polynomial fit to THERMINATOR simulation.  For the \LamKs results shown in the figure, the \LamKs and \ALamKs analyses were fit simultaneously across all centralities (0-10\%, 10-30\%, 30-50\%); scattering parameters and a single $\lambda$ parameter were shared amongst all, the radii were shared amongst results of like-centrality, and each has a unique normalization parameter.  For the \LamKpm results shown, all four pair combinations were fit simultaneously (\LamKchP, \ALamKchM, \LamKchM, \ALamKchP) across all centralities.  Scattering parameters were shared between pair-conjugate systems (i.e. a parameter set describing \LamKchP \& \ALamKchM, and a separate set describing \LamKchM \& \ALamKchP).  For each centrality, a radius and $\lambda$ parameters were shared between all pairs.  Each analysis has a unique normalization parameter.
