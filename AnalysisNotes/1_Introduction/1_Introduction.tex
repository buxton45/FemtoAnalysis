\section{Introduction}

We present results from a femtoscopic analysis of \LamK and $\Xi^{-}$\Kpm correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE experiment at the LHC.  
All pair combinations of \Lam and \ALam with \KchP, \KchM and \Ks are analyzed.  
The femtoscopic correlations are the result of strong final-state interactions, and are fit with a parametrization based on a model by R. Lednicky and V. L. Lyuboshitz \cite{Lednicky:82}.  
This allows us to both characterize the emission source and measure the scattering parameters for the particle pairs.  
We observe a large difference in the \LamKchPALamKchM and \LamKchMALamKchP correlations in pairs with low relative momenta (\kstar $\lesssim$ 100 MeV).   
The results suggest an effect arising from different quark-antiquark interactions in the pairs, i.e. $\rm s\bar{s}$ in \LamKchPALamKchM and $\rm u\bar{u}$ in \LamKchMALamKchP, or from different net strangeness for each system.  
To gain further insight into this hypothesis, we currently are conducting a $\Xi$K femtoscopic analysis.
