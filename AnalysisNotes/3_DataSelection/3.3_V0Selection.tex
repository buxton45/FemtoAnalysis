\subsection{V0 Selection}
\label{V0Selection}

$\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) and K$^{0}_{S}$ are neutral particles which cannot be directly detected, but must instead be reconstructed through detection of their decay products, or daughters.  
This process is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:V0Reconstruction}.
In general, particles which are topologically reconstructed in this fashion are called V0 particles.
The class AliFemtoV0TrackCutNSigmaFilter (which is an extension of AliFemtoV0TrackCut) is used to reconstruct the V0s.
