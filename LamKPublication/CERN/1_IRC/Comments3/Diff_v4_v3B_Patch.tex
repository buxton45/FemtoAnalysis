 The first measurements of the scattering parameters of $\Lambda$K pairs in all three charge combinations ($\Lambda$K$^{+}$, $\Lambda$K$^{-}$, and $\Lambda\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}$) are presented.
 The measurements are achieved through a femtoscopic analysis of $\Lambda$K correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV from ALICE at the LHC.  
 The femtoscopic correlations result from strong final-state interactions, and are fit with a parametrization allowing for both the characterization of the pair emission source and the measurement of the scattering parameters for the particle pairs.
-Extensive studies with the THERMINATOR 2 event generator allow for the description of the non-femtoscopic background, resulting mainly from collective effects, with unprecedented precision.
+Extensive studies with the THERMINATOR 2 event generator provide a good description of the non-femtoscopic background, which result mainly from collective effects, with unprecedented precision.
 Furthermore, this model together with HIJING simulations are used to account for contributions from residual correlations induced by feed-down from resonances.
 The extracted scattering parameters indicate that the strong force is repulsive in the \LamKchP interaction and attractive in the \LamKchM and \LamKs interactions.
 The results suggest an effect arising from different quark-antiquark interactions between the pairs ($\rm s\overline{s}$ in $\Lambda$K$^{+}$ and $\rm u\overline{u}$ in $\Lambda$K$^{-}$), or from different net strangeness for each system (S=0 for $\Lambda$K$^{+}$, and S=$-2$ for $\Lambda$K$^{-}$).

-Femtoscopic analyses of pions, kaons, and protons have revealed a trend of decreasing source radii with increasing transverse mass \cite{Adam:2015vja}, which, for identical particle pairs, is defined as $m_{\mathrm{T}}^{2} = m^{2} + k_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}$, where $k_{\mathrm{T}} = \frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T},1} + \mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T},2}|$.  
-This effect is interpreted as a signature of hydrodynamic flow in the heavy-ion collisions \cite{Akkelin:1995gh}. 
-The exponent for \mt-scaling can be shown analytically to be $-\frac{1}{2}$ for case of a one-dimensional longitudinal hydrodynamic expansion with negligible transverse flow and common freeze-out characteristics, regardless of particle species.
-This has lead to an idea of universal \mt-scaling for different particle species.
-However, it is unclear how the picture changes with significant transverse flow, viscosity corrections, and hadronic rescattering.
-Additionally, the scaling observed in models exists separately for the three-dimensional radii in the Longitudinally Co-Moving System (LCMS), and will at best only be approximate in the Pair Rest Frame (PRF) \cite{Adam:2015vja, Kisiel:2014upa}.
-
-The radii extracted from the femtoscopic study are larger than one would except from naively following the trends set forth in the identical particle analyses.  
-However, when dealing with non-identical particles, such as in the present case with \LamK pairs, one should not necessarily expect the exact same trend. 
-In such cases, the pair emission source, measured through femtoscopy, is the superposition of two single-particle sources, each with its own unique size, shape, and space-time position within the medium.
-Although the single-particle sources should abide by the approximate \mt-scaling, the pair sources generally will not.

 Typically, $B(k^{*})$ is obtained using mixed-event pairs \cite{Kopylov:1974th}, i.e. particles from a given event are paired with those from another event.
 Other techniques exist; most notably, one may use same-event pairs after rotating one particle in the pair by 180$^\circ$ in the transverse plane (see Sec.\ \ref{NonFlatBackground} and App.\ \ref{App:StavMethod} for more details).
 For this analysis, the typical mixed-event method is utilized, and each event is mixed with five others for the reference distribution construction.
 In order to mix only similar events, events are binned both in primary vertex location (2 cm bin width) and in centrality (5\% bin width), and only events within a given bin are mixed; i.e. only events of like centrality and of like primary vertex location are mixed.

+
+The contribution of a parent system (e.g. $\Sigma^{0}$\KchP) to the daughter correlation function (e.g. \LamKchP) is determined by modeling the parent system's correlation function and running it through the appropriate transform matrix.
+Since the interactions between these particles are not known, some assumptions must be made.
+When modeling the parent systems, the source radii are assumed to be equal to those of the daughter \LamK systems.

+The systems resulting from electromagnetic or weak decays ($\Sigma^{0}$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$) will survive long after kinetic freeze-out, and will contribute residual signals to the \LamK correlation functions.
+The majority of the remaining contributors decay via the strong interaction with mean proper lifetimes less than a few fm/$c$, and whose daughters should always be considered primary.
+The mean proper lifetime of the parent is used to judge whether or not the daughter is treated as primary.
+A decay product is considered primary if its parent has a mean proper lifetime $\tau$ satisfying $c\tau <$ 10 fm.
+Changing $c\tau$ only moderately affects the $\lambda_{ij}$ parameters, and the effect is included in the estimation of the systematic uncertainties.
+In order for a pair to be considered primary, both particles in the pair must be considered primary. 
+If either parent has $\tau > \tau_{\mathrm{max}}$, the daughter pair contributes to the ``Other" category when calculating $\lambda$ parameters.
+For this hodgepodge of pair systems, all with different two-particle interactions and single-particle source distributions, we assume the net correlation effect averages to unity.

+Residual contributions from $\Sigma^{0}$, $\Xi^{0}$, $\Xi^{-}$ are accounted for in the fit.
+The $\lambda_{ij}$ values used can be found in Table \ref{tab:LambdaValues_3Res}, which also included values for ``Other'' and ``Fakes''.  
+The ``Other'' category contains pairs which are not considered primary, and which do not originate from the residual contributors accounted for in the fit.  
+The ``Fakes'' category represents pairs that are mistakenly identified as \LamK.  
+To estimate the $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fakes}}$ value, the number of fake pairs is assumed to be equal to the total number of simulated pairs multiplied by $(1-PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}})/PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}}$, where $PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}}$ is the \LamK pair purity, estimated as the product of the two single-particle purities ($PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}} = P_{\Lambda}P_{\mathrm{K}}$).

 The background may be effectively reduced by forming the reference distribution ($B(k^{*})$) with the ``Stavinskiy method".
 With the Stavinskiy method, mixed-event pairs are not used for the reference distribution; instead, same-event pseudo-pairs, formed by rotating one particle in a real pair by 180$^\circ$ in the transverse plane, are used.  
 This rotation rids the pairs of any femtoscopic correlation, while maintaining correlations due to elliptic flow (and other suitably symmetric contributors).

 Additionally, for the extracted fit parameters, a systematic analysis was done on the fit method through varying the \kstar fit range, varying the modeling of the non-femtoscopic background, as well as varying $\tau_{\mathrm{max}}$ defining the primary category in the treatment of residual correlations.
 The choice of \kstar fit range was varied by $\pm$ 25\%. 
 As previously stated, the non-femtoscopic backgrounds are modeled with a polynomial fit to the THERMINATOR 2 simulation, scaled to match the data.

 The resulting uncertainties in the extracted parameter sets were combined with the uncertainties arising from the particle and pair cuts.

 \section{Stavinskiy Reference Method}
 \label{App:StavMethod}
 
 Another option for obtaining the reference distribution, $B(k^{*})$, is to use, what will be referred to as, the ``Stavinskiy method" \cite{Stavinskiy04}.
 The method was first proposed to handle the case of one event femtoscopy, and has been suggested for use in eliminating momentum conservation effects in the reference distribution \cite{Lisa:2005dd}.
 The method is appropriate for collisions between symmetric projectiles, at sufficiently large energy, with a detector which is symmetrical with respect to the transition $\mathbf{r} \rightarrow \mathbf{-r}$.
+The use of this method in a three-dimensional analysis of two-pion correlations produced, in comparison to the event mixing results, an increase of 6\% for $R_{\mathrm{side}}$ at low-$k_{\mathrm{T}}$ and up to 4\% for $R_{\mathrm{out}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{long}}$ \cite{Aamodt:2011mr}.
 The purpose of using the Stavinskiy method in this \LamK analysis is to rid the correlation functions of the non-femtoscopic background.  
 More specifically, the intent is to handle background contributions from elliptic flow, and other sources having reflection symmetry in the transverse plane.  
 With the Stavinskiy method, mixed-event pairs are not used for the reference distribution; instead, same-event pseudo-pairs, formed by rotating one particle in a real pair by 180$^\circ$ in the transverse plane, are used.  
@@ -1215,24 +1036,9 @@
 The results of correctly implementing such a procedure are shown in Figure \ref{fig:StavCfs_Correct_LamKchP}.  
 The figure shows the Stavinskiy method does a very good job of ridding the \LamKchP correlations of their non-femtoscopic backgrounds.

 To build a fit function for a system including both strong and Coulomb interactions two related options were considered. 
 The first option was to numerically integrate Eq.\ \ref{eqn:KooninPrattEqn}.  
 The second option was to simulate a large sample of particle pairs, calculate the wave function describing the interaction, and average to obtain the integral in Eq.\ \ref{eqn:KooninPrattEqn}.

+\label{App:THERM}
+
+Fig.\ \ref{fig:LamKchP_StdThermSources} shows \LamKchP results from the THERMINATOR 2 event generator for an impact parameter of $b = 2$ fm.
+As THERMINATOR 2 does not include any final state effects, the femtoscopic correlation was introduced by assuming a set of scattering parameters ($\Re f_{0},\, \Im f_{0},\, d_{0}$) = ($-$0.60 fm, 0.51 fm, 0.83 fm) and weighting the signal distribution (numerator pairs) with the modulus squared of the two-particle wave function, $|\Psi|^{2}$.
+
+The top row of Fig. \ref{fig:LamKchP_StdThermSources} shows the experimental $\Lambda\mathrm{K}^{+}\oplus\overline{\Lambda}\mathrm{K}^{-}$ data together with the simulation results for the one-dimension correlation function (top left) and for the $\Re C_{11}$ component of the spherical harmonic decomposition (top right).
+The other four plots in Fig.\ \ref{fig:LamKchP_StdThermSources} show the source distribution from the simulation in the out (middle left), side (middle right), and long (bottom left) directions, as well as the temporal characteristics of the source (bottom right), all measured in the PRF.
+The source distributions have all been fitted with a Gaussian form, the results of which are printed within the respective plots.
+One immediately sees a significant spatial shift in the out direction, $\mu_{\mathrm{out}} \approx$ 4 fm, and negligible shift in the other two directions, $\mu_{\mathrm{side}} \approx \mu_{\mathrm{long}} \approx$ 0 fm.
+In other words, the figure demonstrates that, within the THERMINATOR 2 model, the \Lam is, on average, emitted further out than its K partner.
+Additionally, the figure shows a nonzero temporal shift, $\mu_{\Delta t} \approx$ $-$2.7 fm/$c$, signifying that the \Lam is, on average, emitted earlier than its K partner within the model.

 This section concludes with a brief look at how a spatial separation of the single particle sources affects the radii extracted from a femtoscopic analysis.
 To achieve this, THERMINATOR 2 is used in a similar fashion as described above, but with one important difference.
 Instead of taking the source information from THERMINATOR 2, the source is drawn from a pre-determined Gaussian distribution.
-In all cases, $R_{\mathrm{out}} = R_{\mathrm{side}} = R_{\mathrm{long}}$ = 5 fm, and $\mu_{\mathrm{side}} = \mu_{\mathrm{long}}$ = 0 fm.
-In Figure \ref{fig:LamKchP_ThermSources_VaryMuOut}, results are shown for the case of $\mu_{\mathrm{out}}$ = 1 fm, $\mu_{\mathrm{out}}$ = 3 fm, and $\mu_{\mathrm{out}}$ = 6 fm.
-In this figure, the side and long distributions are not shown, as they are simple Gaussians of width 5 fm centered about the origin.
+In all, $R_{\mathrm{out}} = R_{\mathrm{side}} = R_{\mathrm{long}}$ = 5 fm, and $\mu_{\mathrm{side}} = \mu_{\mathrm{long}}$ = 0 fm.
+The cases of $\mu_{\mathrm{out}}$ = 0 fm, $\mu_{\mathrm{out}}$ = 1 fm, $\mu_{\mathrm{out}}$ = 3 fm, and $\mu_{\mathrm{out}}$ = 6 fm were studied within the simulation.
+Note, within this implementation there is no time difference in the emission of the \Lam and K particles.
+For each, a one-dimensional correlation function is generated and fit with the Lednick\'y model, as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:LamKchP_ThermSources_VaryMuOut}).
+The scattering parameters are known precisely here, as they served as the weights used in the simulation, and are kept constant in the fit.
+Only the extracted one-dimensional source size is of interest here, so the $\lambda$ parameter is also fixed at unity.
 The figure demonstrates that as the separation $\mu_{\mathrm{out}}$ increases, so do the extracted femtoscopic radii.
