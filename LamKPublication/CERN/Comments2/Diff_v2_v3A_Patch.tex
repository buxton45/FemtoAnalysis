 \label{sec:Introduction}
 
 Femtoscopy is an experimental method used to study the space-time characteristic of the particle emitting sources in relativistic particle collisions \cite{Lisa:2005dd}.

\underline{\color{blue}{With this method, two (or many)-particle relative-momentum correlation functions are used to connect the final-state momentum distributions to the space-time distributions of particle emission at freeze-out. }}
 The correlation functions are sensitive to quantum statistics, as well as strong and Coulomb final-state interactions (FSI).  
 Current femtoscopic studies are able to extract the size, shape, and orientation of the pair emission regions, as well as offering estimations of the total time to reach kinetic decoupling and the suddenness of particle emission.
 Non-identical particle analyses additionally allow for the measurement of the space-time separation of the single particle source emitting regions.
 The momentum and species dependence of femtoscopic measurements affirm the collective nature of the hot and dense matter created in heavy-ion collisions.
 
 In addition to characterizing the source region, femtoscopy offers a unique environment in which to measure nuclear scattering parameters, many of which are difficult, if not impossible, to measure otherwise.  
\sout{\color{red}{This aspect of femtoscopy is the focal point of the present analysis.}}

 The \LamK analysis presented offers low energy QCD measurements, which fall into the non-perturbative regime of QCD.
 Therefore, the \LamK measurements not only give insight into the strong interaction, they will also help guide future QCD calculations.
 This study is also particularly interesting, as the \LamK scattering parameters are not known, and therefore the behavior of the system cannot be predicted beforehand.

 Particle identification (PID) for reconstructed tracks was carried out using both the TPC and Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector \cite{Abelev:2014ffa, Akindinov:2013tea} in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 0.8$.  
 For TPC PID, a parametrized Bethe-Bloch formula was used to calculate the specific energy loss $\langle \mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}x \rangle$ in the detector expected for a particle with a given mass and momentum.  
 For TOF PID, the particle mass was used to calculate the expected time-of-flight as a function of track length and momentum.  
-For each PID method, a value ($N\sigma$) was assigned to each track denoting the number of standard deviations between the measured track information and calculated values.

 \Kpm track detection utilized both TPC and TOF detectors, and tracks within the range 0.14 $<$ \pt $<$ 1.5 GeV/$c$ were accepted.
 To reduce the number of secondaries (e.g. charged particles produced in the detector material, particles from weak decays, etc.) in the sample, a maximum cut is established on the distance-of-closest-approach (DCA) of the track to the primary vertex.
 This restriction is realized by imposing a DCA cut in both the transverse and beam directions.
 
-PID was performed using both the TPC and TOF detectors via the $\mathrm{N}\sigma$ method. 
-The $\mathrm{N}\sigma$ cuts become tighter with increasing momentum to reduce contamination within the samples, as the \Kpm signals begin to overlap more significantly with those from other particles, particularly e$^{\pm}$ and $\pi^{\pm}$.

+
+In practice, the contribution of a parent system (e.g. $\Sigma^{0}$\KchP) to the daughter correlation function (e.g. \LamKchP) is determined by modeling the parent system's correlation function and running it through the appropriate transform matrix.
+Since the interactions between these particles are not known, all residual pairs are assumed to have the same source size as the daughter pair.
+Furthermore, Coulomb-neutral residual pairs are assumed to share the same scattering parameters as the daughter pair.
+When modeling \XiKpm residual correlations, the experimental \XiKpm data is used. 
+Consistent results are found when modeling the \XiKpm system, in which the the strong interaction is assumed to be negligible, and the parent correlation is generated assuming a Coulomb-only scenario (see Appendix \ref{App:CoulombFitter} for more details).
+This approximation is well justified here as a Coulomb-only description of the system describes, reasonably well, the broad features of the correlation.

+The $\lambda_{ij}$ parameters dictate the relative strength of each contribution to the correlation function, and can be estimated using the THERMINATOR 2 and HIJING simulations.

+The number of detected \LamK pairs involves both the raw yields and the reconstruction efficiencies.
 The reconstruction efficiencies ($RE_{ij}$) are estimated with MC HIJING data, which has been run through GEANT to simulate the detector response.
 HIJING events are generated from a superposition of PYTHIA p-p collisions, and lack the strangeness saturation of a fully thermalized medium.
 As a result, HIJING is unreliable in providing the yields needed for this analysis, and, instead, the yields are estimated with the THERMINATOR 2 simulation ($N_{ij}^{\scaleto{THERM}{3pt}}$).
-The $\lambda$ parameters are then estimated as

 Therefore, in the eyes of femtoscopy, any particle born from a resonance decay before last rescattering is seen as primary.
-For this study, a particle is considered to be primary if its parent has a proper decay length of $c\tau <$ 10 fm. 
-With this selection, residual contributions from $\Sigma^{0}$, $\Xi^{0}$, $\Xi^{-}$ must be accounted for in the fit.
-The $\lambda$ values used can be found in Table \ref{tab:LambdaValues_3Res}, which also included values for ``Other'' and ``Fakes''.  
+The THERMINATOR 2 simulation shows that, aside from primaries, the \Lam hyperons and K mesons decay from a large number of resonances ($\sim$50 \Lam parent species, and $\sim$70 K parent species), and the most significant contributing pair systems are $\Sigma^{0}$K, $\Xi^{-}$K, $\Xi^{0}$K, $\Sigma^{*+}$K, $\Sigma^{*-}$K, $\Sigma^{*0}$K, $\Lambda\mathrm{K}^{*}$, $\Sigma^{0}\mathrm{K}^{*}$, $\Xi^{-}\mathrm{K}^{*}$, and $\Xi^{0}\mathrm{K}^{*}$.
+However, the simulation does not include a hadronic rescattering phase, and not all of the aforementioned pair systems will survive until kinetic freeze-out.
+The systems resulting from electromagnetic or weak decays ($\Sigma^{0}$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$) will survive long after kinetic freeze-out, and will contribute residual signals to the \LamK correlation functions.
+The majority of the remaining contributors decay via the strong interaction with mean proper lifetimes less than a few fm/$c$, and whose daughters should always be considered primary.
+The mean proper lifetime of the parent is used to judge whether or not the daughter is treated as primary.
+A decay product is considered primary if its parent has a mean proper lifetime $\tau$ satisfying $c\tau <$ 10 fm.
+Changing $c\tau$ only moderately affects the $\lambda_{ij}$ parameters, and the effect is included the estimation of the systematic uncertainties.
+In order for a pair to be considered primary, both particles in the pair must be considered primary. 
+If either parent has $\tau > \tau_{\mathrm{max}}$, the daughter pair contributes to the ``Other" category when calculating $\lambda$ parameters.
+For this hodgepodge of pair systems, all with different two-particle interactions and single-particle source distributions, we assume the net correlation effect averages to unity.
+
+
+Residual contributions from $\Sigma^{0}$, $\Xi^{0}$, $\Xi^{-}$ are accounted for in the fit.
+The $\lambda_{ij}$ values used can be found in Table \ref{tab:LambdaValues_3Res}, which also included values for ``Other'' and ``Fakes''.  
 The ``Other'' category contains pairs which are not considered primary, and which do not originate from the residual contributors accounted for in the fit.  
 The ``Fakes'' category represents pairs that are mistakenly identified as \LamK.  
-To estimate this $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fakes}}$ value, the number of fake pairs is assumed to be equal to the total number of pairs multiplied by the \Lam purity (i.e. assuming perfect purity for the kaons); or, more simply, $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fakes}}$ = 1.0 $-$ Purity(\Lam).  
-For both of these contributors (``Other'' and ``Fakes''), it is assumed that these correlations average to unity, and therefore do not contribute to the final correlation function.
-
-In practice, the contribution of a parent system (e.g. $\Sigma^{0}$\KchP) to the daughter correlation function (e.g. \LamKchP) is determined by modeling the parent system's correlation function and running it through the appropriate transform matrix.
-However, little is know about the interaction between the particles in the residual pairs of this study, and assumptions must be made.
-For this analysis, all residual pairs are assumed to have the same source size as the daughter pair.
-Furthermore, Coulomb-neutral residual pairs are assumed to share the same scattering parameters as the daughter pair.
-Therefore, for Coulomb-neutral pairs, such as $\Sigma^{0}$K, and $\Xi^{0}$K, $C_{ij}(k^{*}_{ij})$ is calculated from Eqn. \ref{eqn:LednickyEqn}, with the help of Eqn. \ref{eqn:CFSI2}; $C_{ij}(k^{*}_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}})$ is then obtained by transforming $C_{ij}(k^{*}_{ij})$ with Eq. \ref{eqn:ResidualsTransform}, using the appropriate transform matrix.  
-
-For residual pairs affected by both the strong and Coulomb interactions, things are a bit more complicated.
-This is due to the fact that, for the case of both strong and Coulomb interaction, there no longer exists a nice analytical form with which to fit.
-Generating a correlation function including both is also time consuming, as described further in Appendix \ref{App:CoulombFitter}.
-When modeling \XiKpm residual correlations, the experimental \XiKpm data is used; in this case, there is no need to make any assumptions about scattering parameters or source sizes. 
-Consist results are found when modeling the \XiKpm system, in which the the strong interaction is assumed to be negligible, and the parent correlation is generated assuming a Coulomb-only scenario (see Appendix \ref{App:CoulombFitter} for more details).
-This approximation is well justified here as a Coulomb-only description of the system describes, reasonably well, the broad features of the correlation; the strong interaction is necessary for the fine details.  
-As these correlations are run through a transform matrix, which largely flattens out and fine details, a Coulomb-only description should be sufficient.   
+To estimate the $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fakes}}$ value, the number of fake pairs is assumed to be equal to the total number of simulated pairs multiplied by $(1-PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}})/PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}}$, where $PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}}$ is the \LamK pair purity, estimated as the product of the two single-particle purities ($PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}} = P_{\Lambda}P_{\mathrm{K}}$).
+More simply, this amounts to $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fakes}} = 1.0-PP_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}}$.
+The correlations in both of these categories (``Other'' and ``Fakes'') are assumed to average to unity, and pairs in these categories therefore only contribute by attenuating the signal.

 \subsection{Momentum Resolution Corrections}
@@ -688,7 +679,6 @@
 Finite track momentum resolution causes the reconstructed momentum of a particle to smear around the true value.
 This, of course, also holds true for \Vz particles.
 The effect is propagated up to the pairs of interest, which causes the reconstructed relative momentum (\krec) to differ from the true momentum (\ktrue).
-Smearing of the momentum typically will result in a suppression and broadening of the signal.
 The effects of finite momentum resolution are accounted for through the use of a response matrix generated with MC HIJING data.
 With this approach, the resolution correction is applied on-the-fly during the fitting process by propagating the theoretical (fit) correlation function through the response matrix, according to

 \subsection{Non-Femtoscopic Background}
 \label{NonFlatBackground}
 
-A significant non-femtoscopic, non-flat, background is observed in all of the studied \LamK correlations at large \kstar.  
-This background increases with decreasing centrality, is the same amongst all \LamKpm pairs, and is more pronounced in the \LamKs system.
-This difference in \LamKpm and \LamKs backgrounds is due mainly to the difference in kinematic cuts, not due to any interesting physics.  
-
-It is suggested that this background effect is due primarily to particle collimation associated with elliptic flow \cite{Kisiel:2017}.  
-More specifically, these backgrounds result from mixing events with unlike event-plane angles ($\Psi_{\textrm{EP}}$).  
-As explained in \cite{Kisiel:2017}, when elliptic flow is present, all particles are more likely to be emitted in a specific direction (in-plane), as opposed to a perpendicular direction.  
-Therefore, the difference in momenta for pairs of particles tends to be smaller, compared to the case of no flow.  
-In the case of mixed-event pairs, the two events used do not share an event-plane, and therefore there is no collimation effect in the pairs from flow.  
-As a result, pairs with larger momentum are more likely when mixed-events are used (in the denominator of the correlation function), causing the correlation function to dip below unity.  
-This same reasoning suggests that the background should lead to an enhancement at low-\kstar. 
-An attempt was made to decrease this background through the binning of events in $\Psi_{\mathrm{EP}}$, but only a small reduction in the signal was achieved due to the limited event-plane resolution.
-
-THERMINATOR 2 simulation has been shown to reproduce the background features in a $\pi$K analysis \cite{Kisiel:2017}.  
-After issuing each simulated event a random $\Psi_{\mathrm{EP}}$, THERMINATOR 2 did an exceptional job of describing the \LamK data.  
-Furthermore, the simulation showed the non-femtoscopic background affects the correlation function as a separable scale factor.
-Figure \ref{fig:BgdswTHERM} shows the THERMINATOR 2 simulation (gold) together with experimental data (red, blue, or black).  
-The figure also shows a 6$^{th}$-order polynomial fit to the simulation (gold), as well as the fit polynomial scaled to match the data (red, blue, black).

 The description by THERMINATOR 2 of the non-femtoscopic backgrounds in the \LamKpm systems is remarkable, and can be used in a quantitative fashion to help fit the data.
 More specifically, the non-femtoscopic backgrounds were modeled by (6$^{\mathrm{th}}$-order) polynomial fits to THERMINATOR 2 simulation for the \LamKpm analyses; one polynomial for each centrality class.
-The form of each polynomial was set before use with the experimental data, by fitting to the THERMINATOR 2 simulation, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:BgdswTHERM}.
-At the time of the fit, the polynomial used to correct each correlation function could only be adjust by a simple scale factor to best match the data.
-The description of the \LamKs is good at a qualitative level, but not quantitatively good enough to be utilized in the fit.
-As such, a linear form is used to model the background in the \LamKs system.
-The background for each correlation function was fixed before use in the signal region by fitting a linear form to the region $0.6 < k^{*} < 0.9$ GeV/$c$.
+The form of each polynomial is set before use with the experimental data, by fitting to the THERMINATOR 2 simulation, shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:BgdswTHERM}.

 In all cases, the non-femtoscopic background correction was applied as a scale factor.

-Therefore, Eq. \ref{eqn:Chi2PML} is used as the statistic quantifying the quality of the fit.
-The parameters of the fit are: $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fit}}$, $R$, $f_{0}$ ($\Re f_{0}$ and $\Im f_{0}$ separately), $d_{0}$, and normalization $N$.
-
+The parameters included in the generation of a correlation function are: $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fit}}$, $R$, $f_{0}$ ($\Re f_{0}$ and $\Im f_{0}$ separately), $d_{0}$, and normalization $\mathcal{N}$.
 For the fit, a given pair and its conjugate (e.g. \LamKchP and \ALamKchM) share scattering parameters ($\Re f_{0}$, $\Im f_{0}$, $d_{0}$), and the three distinct analyses (\LamKchP, \LamKchM, and \LamKs) are assumed to have scattering parameters unique from each other.
 The pair emission source for a given centrality class is assumed similar between all analyses; therefore, for each centrality, all \LamK analyses share a common radius parameter.
-For each centrality class, a single $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fit}}$ parameter (see Eq. \ref{eqn:CfwRes}) is shared amongst all.
+For each centrality class, a single $\lambda_{\mathrm{Fit}}$ parameter (see Eq.\ \ref{eqn:CfwRes}) is shared amongst all.

+All correlation functions are normalized in the range 0.32 $< k^{*} <$ 0.40 GeV/$c$, and fit in the range 0.0 $< k^{*} <$ 0.30 GeV/$c$.
 For the \LamKchM analysis, the region 0.19 $< k^{*} <$ 0.23 GeV/$c$ was excluded from the fit to exclude the bump caused by the $\Omega^{-}$ resonance.
-For each pair system, contributions from three residual contributors are accounted for, as discussed in Sec. \ref{ResidualCorrelations}, and whose individual $\lambda$ values are listed in Table \ref{tab:LambdaValues_3Res}.
-Effects of finite track momentum resolution are also accounted for, as outlined in Sec. \ref{MomentumResolutionCorrections}.
-The non-femtoscopic backgrounds are modeled using the THERMINATOR 2 simulation for the \LamKpm analyses, and with a linear form for the \LamKs system, as described in Sec. \ref{NonFlatBackground}.
-In general, corrections are applied to the fit function, the raw data is never touched.
-
-To summarize, the complete fit function is constructed as follows:
-\begin{enumerate}
- \item The uncorrected, primary, correlation function, $C_{\Lambda\mathrm{K}}$(\ktrue), is constructed using Eqns. \ref{eqn:LednickyEqn} and \ref{eqn:CFSI2}
- \item The correlation functions describing the parent systems which contribute residually are obtained using:
- \begin{itemize}
-  \item Eqns. \ref{eqn:LednickyEqn} and \ref{eqn:CFSI2} for the case of Coulomb-neutral pairs
-  \item \XiKpm experimental data for \XiKpm contributions
-  \item a Coulomb-only curve, with the help of Appendix \ref{App:CoulombFitter}, for other pairs including the Coulomb interaction 
- \end{itemize} 
- \item The residual contributions to the \LamK correlation function is found by running each parent correlation function through the appropriate transform matrix, via Eq.\ref{eqn:ResidualsTransform}
- \item The primary and residual correlations are combined, via Eq.\ref{eqn:CfwRes} with Tab. \ref{tab:LambdaValues_3Res}, to form $C'_{Fit}$(\ktrue)
- \item The correlation function is corrected to account for momentum resolution effects using Eq. \ref{eqn:MomResCorrection}, to obtain $C'_{\mathrm{Fit}}(k^{*}_{\mathrm{Rec}})$
- \item Finally, the non-flat background correction, $F_{\mathrm{Bgd}}(k^{*}_{\mathrm{Rec}})$ is applied, and the final fit function is obtained, $C_{\mathrm{Fit}}(k^{*}_{\mathrm{Rec}}) = C'_{\mathrm{Fit}}(k^{*}_{\mathrm{Rec}})*F_{\mathrm{Bgd}}(k^{*}_{\mathrm{Rec}})$

 These kinematic effects, resulting from the transformation from LCMS to PRF, causes smaller masses to exhibit larger $R_{\mathrm{inv}}$ \cite{Adam:2015vja} (explaining, for instance, how the pion radii are systematically higher than kaon radii at the same approximate \mt).

 At first thought, this may appear to be a troubling result; the approximate scaling is an observed consequence of the collective behavior of the soft (low-\pt) sector of the produced system.

+The \Lam and K particles certainly participate in the collective expansion of the QGP medium, but, importantly, they are non-identical particles, and all other systems in Fig.\ \ref{fig:mTScalingOfRadii_3Res} contain identical particles.
 In the case of identical particle femtoscopy, the pair source is comprised of two identical single particle sources, and the pair source size extracted is simply a factor $\sqrt{2}$ larger than those single particle sources.
 Thus, the identical particle pair source radii naturally follow the single particle source \mt-scaling in a simple manner.
 
 When dealing with non-identical particles, the pair emission source, which is measured by femtoscopy, is the superposition of two single-particle sources.
-In general, each single-particle source will have its own size, shape, and space-time position within the produced medium, which is unique from its paired partner.
 The hydrodynamic nature of the medium produces the approximate \mt-scaling with respect to these single-particle sources, not the pair sources.
-More specifically, the hydrodynamic response of the system confines higher-\mt particles to smaller homogeneity regions, also also pushes their average emission points further in the ``out" direction \cite{Retiere:2003kf}.
+More specifically, the hydrodynamic response of the system confines higher-\mt particles to smaller homogeneity regions, also pushes their average emission points further in the ``out" direction \cite{Retiere:2003kf}.
 Therefore, it is expected that the \Lam source is both smaller in size and further out in the fireball than that of the kaons.
 The combination of two unique sources separated in space-time, when probing correlations between non-identical particle pairs, can lead to extracted radii falling outside of the (identical particle femtoscopy) \mt-scaling trend.
 
 It is well established that non-identical particle femtoscopic studies are able to probe deeper than the second moments of the pair distribution functions accessed via identical particle studies.
-In addition to this, non-identical particle studies are able to measure the relative emission shifts, the first moments of the emission function.

 For the study of \LamK pairs at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions, a separation of the single-particle sources in the out direction is expected.
 One elegant method for extracting information about the emission asymmetries is via a spherical decomposition of the correlation function.
 With this method, one can draw a wealth of information from just a few components of the decomposition.

 Results from a femtoscopic analysis of \LamK correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV with ALICE at the LHC have been presented.
 The femtoscopic radii, $\lambda$ parameters, and scattering parameters were extracted from one-dimensional correlation functions in terms of the invariant momentum difference.
 The scattering parameters of \LamK pairs in all three charge combinations (\LamKchP, \LamKchM, and \LamKs) have been measured for the first time.
-A striking difference in the \LamKchP and \LamKchM correlation functions is observed, which is reflected in the unique set of scattering parameters extracted for each.
-The \LamKs systems is somewhat intermediate to these two cases.
-The \LamKchP systems exhibits a negative $\Re(f_{0})$, while those extracted from the \LamKchM and \LamKs systems are positive.
-This implies that the strong interaction is repulsive for the \LamKchP system and attractive for \LamKchM and \LamKs.

+The extracted scattering parameters indicate that the strong force is repulsive in the \LamKchP interaction and attractive in the \LamKchM and \LamKs interactions.
 The physics underlying this phenomenon is currently not well understood, but this could be due to different quark-antiquark interactions between the pairs, or from different net strangeness for each system. 
 The non-femtoscopic background is found to result almost entirely from collective effects, and is described quantitatively with unprecedented precision with the THERMINATOR 2 event generator.
 Finally, the \LamK systems exhibit source radii larger than expected from extrapolation from identical particle femtoscopic studies.

 More specifically, the intent is to handle background contributions from elliptic flow, and other sources having reflection symmetry in the transverse plane.  
 With the Stavinskiy method, mixed-event pairs are not used for the reference distribution; instead, same-event pseudo-pairs, formed by rotating one particle in a real pair by 180$^\circ$ in the transverse plane, are used.  
 This rotation rids the pairs of any femtoscopic correlation, while maintaining correlations due to elliptic flow (and other suitably symmetric contributors).

+Care needs to be taken in treating the pseudo-pairs exactly like the real pairs; e.g. the pseudo-pairs should be exposed to the same pair cuts used in the analysis on the real pairs.

-Now, one must be somewhat careful when applying this Stavinskiy method.  
-To obtain correct results, the pseudo-pairs must be run through the same pair cuts used for the real pairs in the analyses.  
-In an ideal world, the pair cut would only remove truly bad pairs results from splitting, merging, etc.  
-In the real world, the pair cut always throws out some of the good with the bad.  
-For the pseudo-pairs to form a reliable reference, they too must experience the pair cut, and the loss of ``good'' pseudo-pairs.  
-This issue affected mainly the \LamKchP \& \ALamKchM system in this analysis.

 One immediately sees a significant shift in the out direction, $\mu_{\mathrm{out}} \approx$ 4 fm, and negligible shift in the other two directions, $\mu_{\mathrm{side}} \approx \mu_{\mathrm{long}} \approx$ 0 fm.

 This section concludes with a brief look at how a spatial separation of the single particle sources affects the radii extracted from a femtoscopic analysis.
 To achieve this, THERMINATOR 2 is used in a similar fashion as described above, but with one important difference.
 Instead of taking the source information from THERMINATOR 2, the source is drawn from a pre-determined Gaussian distribution.
 In all cases, $R_{\mathrm{out}} = R_{\mathrm{side}} = R_{\mathrm{long}}$ = 5 fm, and $\mu_{\mathrm{side}} = \mu_{\mathrm{long}}$ = 0 fm.
-In Figure \ref{fig:LamKchP_ThermSources_VaryMuOut}, results are shown for the case of $\mu_{out}$ = 1 fm, $\mu_{out}$ = 3 fm, and $\mu_{out}$ = 6 fm.

 In this figure, the side and long distributions are not shown, as they are simple Gaussians of width 5 fm centered about the origin.
