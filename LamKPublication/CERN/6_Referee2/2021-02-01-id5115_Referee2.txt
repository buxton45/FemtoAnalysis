PROBLEMS WITH MANUSCRIPT:

In reviewing the figures of your paper, we note that the following
changes would be needed in order for your figures to conform to the
style of the Physical Review.  Please check all figures for the
following problems and make appropriate changes in the text of the
paper itself wherever needed for consistency.

Please list Figures A.1, C.1, C.2, C.3 as Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10.

Figure(s) [1-4, 6, 7, 9]
         Figure sublabels should be printed on the figures.  The
         preferred form is lowercase letters in parentheses:  (a),
         (b), etc.

Figure(s) [1, 8]
         Please rearrange power of 10 in axis label for clarity:  Either
         (i) place the power of 10 as a factor, without parentheses, in
         front of the axis label quantity, changing the sign of the power
         as needed; or (ii) incorporate the power of 10 in the topmost
         or rightmost number on the scale.  Please refer to the URL
         https://journals.aps.org/authors/axis-labels-and-scales-on-graphs-h18
         for a pictorial representation of the preferred forms for
         axis labels.

Figure(s) [Please check all and amend where necessary]
          Please increase the font size (axis labels, axis scale
          values, legend, etc.). Please ensure that all lettering is
          2 mm or larger (1.5 mm for superscripts and subscripts)
          after scaling to the final publication size. Note that
          the column width is 8.6 cm (twice that amount plus gutter
          for extra wide figures).
